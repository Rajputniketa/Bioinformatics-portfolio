# CFTR ΔF508 Mutation Analysis (Python)

## Objective
To computationally identify the ΔF508 deletion mutation
in the CFTR protein sequence using Python.

## Biological Significance
ΔF508 is the most common mutation responsible for
cystic fibrosis, causing protein misfolding and degradation.

## Tasks Performed
- Compared wild-type and mutant sequences
- Identified deletion mutation
- Reported mutation position

## Industry Relevance
Variant detection and interpretation are core tasks in
clinical bioinformatics and genetic diagnostics companies.
